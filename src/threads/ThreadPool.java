Imagine a cargo company that needs to deliver 9 courier boxes to different locations.
The company hires delivery boys to handle these deliveries.

Let's compare how the company operates without a thread pool and with a thread pool.

Without Thread Pool (One Delivery Boy for Each Delivery)

Imagine this company is new, Manager has no prior experience.
Since there are 9 courier boxes, the company hires 9 different delivery boysâ€”one for each.
He hires 9 delivery boys
The delivery boys pick up one box each, deliver it to 9 locations.
Delivery boys happy, customers happy. Business NOT HAPPY AT ALL =>
ðŸš¨ Problems:
COST INCREASED, INEFFICIENT USE OF EXISTING RESOURCES, INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES IF MORE THAN 9 DELIVERIES TO BE MADE


With Thread Pool (A Fixed Team of Delivery Boys)

Now, imagine the company has gained experience and the manager has learned from mistakes.
Instead of hiring a new delivery boy for every single courier, he optimizes the system.

The company hires only 3 delivery boys, forming a fixed team.

The first 3 courier boxes arrive â†’ 3 delivery boys pick them up and start delivering.
While they are out for delivery, the next 6 courier boxes wait in the queue.
As soon as a delivery boy returns, he picks up the next waiting box.
The cycle continues until all deliveries are completed.
ðŸš€ Now, Business is Happy!
âœ… COST REDUCED â€“ No need to hire/fire new delivery boys for every courier.
âœ… EFFICIENT RESOURCE USE â€“ Delivery boys stay busy but are reused for multiple tasks.
âœ… SCALABLE â€“ Even if 20 couriers arrive, deliveries happen steadily without chaos.

ðŸ’¡ Conclusion: Instead of creating a new worker for every task, the company efficiently reuses a fixed team, just like a ThreadPool efficiently reuses threads instead of creating new ones each time!
